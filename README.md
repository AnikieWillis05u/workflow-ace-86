# AI Workplace Ally

Build a modern, responsive, professional web application called AI Workplace Productivity Assistant. The application should be a single integrated productivity platform that helps professionals automate everyday workplace tasks using AI.

Core Concept

Create one unified application with three main AI-powered tools:

Meeting Notes Summarizer

AI Task Planner

AI Chatbot Interface

All three tools must share the same application layout, navigation, design system, user experience, and AI workflow. The app should feel like one polished product rather than three separate pages.

Design & Branding

Use a clean, modern SaaS-style interface suitable for professionals.

Responsive on desktop, tablet, and mobile

Professional but friendly visual design

Minimal, uncluttered interface

Rounded cards and buttons

Subtle shadows

Smooth hover and transition animations

Modern typography

Accessible contrast

Light default theme with optional dark mode

Consistent iconography

Professional AI-focused branding

Use a blue/indigo/purple-inspired modern technology aesthetic

Include a compact sidebar on desktop and collapsible navigation on smaller screens

Main Application Layout

Create:

Left Sidebar

Logo: AI Workplace Productivity Assistant

Dashboard

Main Dashboard

Show a welcoming overview with:

"Good morning" greeting

Productivity summary

Tasks completed

Pending tasks

Meetings summarized

AI interactions

Quick-action buttons

Example quick actions:

Meeting Notes Summarizer

Create a complete AI-powered meeting summarization workspace.

The user should be able to:

Paste meeting notes

Paste a meeting transcript

Upload a supported text/document file

Enter a meeting title

Enter attendees

Enter meeting date

Select meeting type

Provide a prominent "Summarize with AI" button.

The AI-generated result should be organized into:

Meeting Overview

Short summary

Key Discussion Points

Important topics discussed

Decisions Made

Decisions reached during the meeting

Action Items

Task

Assigned person

Deadline

Priority

Important Follow-Ups

Items requiring additional attention

Questions & Open Issues

Unresolved questions

Allow users to:

Copy summary

Edit summary

Export summary

Convert action items into tasks

Save summary to Meeting History

Share summary

Include a processing/loading state while AI generates the summary.

AI Task Planner

Create an intelligent task-management workspace.

Allow the user to enter a goal or project such as:

"Prepare a marketing presentation for next week's client meeting."

The AI should generate a structured task plan containing:

Main goal

Recommended tasks

Subtasks

Priority

Estimated time

Suggested deadlines

Dependencies

Status

Display tasks using modern cards or a Kanban-style layout:

To Do In Progress Completed

Each task should support:

Mark complete

Edit

Delete

Change priority

Assign deadline

Add notes

Add subtasks

Include AI actions such as:

Break Goal Into Tasks

Prioritize Tasks

Create Schedule

Improve My Plan

Find Next Best Task

The planner should intelligently prioritize tasks based on urgency, importance, deadlines, and dependencies.

AI Chatbot Interface

Create a professional AI assistant chat interface.

The chatbot should help users with workplace productivity tasks such as:

Writing emails

Summarizing documents

Creating task lists

Brainstorming ideas

Preparing meeting agendas

Creating reports

Rewriting professional messages

Explaining workplace concepts

Planning projects

Generating action items

Interface requirements:

Chat message history

User and AI message bubbles

AI typing/loading indicator

Text input area

Send button

Attachment button

Clear conversation button

Copy AI response button

Regenerate response button

Add suggested prompts above the input:

"Summarize this document"

"Create a task plan"

"Draft a professional email"

"Prepare a meeting agenda"

"Help me prioritize my tasks"

The chatbot should understand the context of the user's productivity data where appropriate.

Integrated AI Experience

The three tools must work together.

For example:

Meeting → Tasks

After summarizing a meeting, the user can click:

"Convert Action Items to Tasks"

Those action items should automatically appear in the Task Planner.

Task Planner → AI Chat

The user can ask the AI:

"Which of my tasks should I work on first?"

The AI should use the user's current task data when generating the response.

Meeting Summarizer → AI Chat

Allow users to send a meeting summary directly to the chatbot and ask follow-up questions.

Dashboard Analytics

Include productivity statistics such as:

Tasks completed this week

Tasks remaining

Meetings summarized

AI conversations

Productivity trend

Completion rate

Use attractive charts and visual indicators without overwhelming the interface.

Notifications

Create a notification panel for:

Upcoming deadlines

Overdue tasks

Recently completed tasks

Meeting summaries ready

AI-generated recommendations

Search

Add global search functionality that can search:

Tasks

Meetings

Conversations

Notes

Display results in a clean searchable interface.

Meeting History

Create a history page showing previous meeting summaries.

Each meeting card should display:

Meeting title

Date

Number of attendees

Short summary

Number of action items

Status

Allow users to open, edit, delete, export, or convert meeting action items into tasks.

My Tasks

Create a dedicated task-management page with:

All tasks

Today

Upcoming

Overdue

Completed

Include filtering and sorting by:

Priority

Due date

Status

Project

Settings

Create a professional settings page containing:

Profile settings

AI preferences

Notification preferences

Appearance

Theme

Data/privacy settings

Connected AI services

Account settings

AI Integration Architecture

Design the application so that AI functionality is separated into reusable services/components.

Create an AI service layer capable of connecting to an AI API such as OpenAI.

Do not expose API keys in frontend code.

Use environment variables for API credentials.

Create reusable AI functions such as:

summarizeMeeting()

generateTaskPlan()

prioritizeTasks()

chatWithAssistant()

generateActionItems()

The interface should include realistic demo data and functional mock AI responses if an API connection has not yet been configured.

Data Model

Use a clean data structure for:

Users

id

name

email

avatar

preferences

Meetings

id

title

date

attendees

transcript

summary

decisions

actionItems

Tasks

id

title

description

priority

status

dueDate

estimatedTime

project

subtasks

Chat Conversations

id

messages

createdAt

updatedAt

Responsive Behavior

Desktop:

Persistent sidebar

Large dashboard

Multi-column layouts

Tablet:

Collapsible sidebar

Adaptive cards

Two-column layouts where appropriate

Mobile:

Bottom navigation or collapsible menu

Single-column layouts

Touch-friendly controls

Responsive chat interface

Responsive task cards

Mobile-friendly meeting editor

User Experience

Add:

Smooth page transitions

Loading skeletons

Empty states

Error states

Success notifications

Confirmation dialogs

Tooltips

Toast notifications

Keyboard-friendly interactions

Accessible form controls

Make every major button and interaction functional.

Landing/Login Experience

Create a polished login/welcome screen before entering the application.

Headline:

"Work Smarter. Get More Done with AI."

Supporting text:

"Your intelligent workplace assistant for meetings, tasks, projects, and everyday productivity."

Buttons:

Get Started Sign In

After authentication, take the user to the main dashboard.

Technical Requirements

Build the application using a modern frontend architecture such as:

React

TypeScript

Tailwind CSS

Modern component library

Responsive design

Reusable components

Clean state management

API-ready architecture

Use reusable components for:

Sidebar

Header

Cards

Buttons

Modal dialogs

Task cards

Meeting summaries

Chat messages

Notifications

Charts

Forms

Keep the code modular, maintainable, and production-ready.

Important Requirement

This must be ONE integrated application, not three disconnected applications.

The user should be able to move naturally between:

Dashboard → Meeting Summarizer → Action Items → Task Planner → AI Chat → Dashboard

The application should feel like a single intelligent workplace assistant that remembers and connects the user's productivity information.

Final Product Goal

Create a polished SaaS-quality application that looks like a real commercial AI productivity product.

The final experience should communicate:

"One AI assistant for your entire workday."

Prioritize usability, professional visual design, responsive behavior, clear information hierarchy, and meaningful integration between the Meeting Notes Summarizer, AI Task Planner, and AI Chatbot.
